# Bug Description Template

Use this template when creating a Bug issue type. Not every section needs filling — only include sections where you have relevant information. Pull as much as possible from the conversation context rather than asking the user to repeat themselves.

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of the bug.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Expected Behavior
What should happen.

## Actual Behavior
What actually happens.

## Impact
How this affects users or the system.

## Environment
- Service: (e.g., the affected service or component)
- Environment: (e.g., local, staging, production)
```

## Guidance

- **Summary** — Required. One or two sentences describing what is broken.
- **Steps to Reproduce** — Include if the user described how to trigger the bug. Skip if the issue is obvious from the summary.
- **Expected / Actual Behavior** — Include both when the distinction adds clarity beyond the summary.
- **Impact** — Include when severity or affected users are mentioned in conversation.
- **Environment** — Include when a specific service, environment, or version is relevant.

Omit any section that would contain placeholder text or add no value. A focused two-section bug report is better than a padded six-section one.
